# Purple Forest front end

Vanilla JS es6 modules. Vanilla CSS. Playwright tests.

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure the backend is running.
3. Serve this directory over HTTP(S).
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.
5. Login with the demo account 'sample' password 'sosecret'

This front end doesn't have a build step. It's just a collection of js modules that interact with the backend api via an apiService module. The entry point is `index.mjs` and this is SPA style, so there's just one html file.
